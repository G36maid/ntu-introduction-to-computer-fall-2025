1.  **Hacker**: A person who uses their technical skills to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, sometimes to find security weaknesses.
2.  **Cracker**: A person who breaks into computer systems or software with malicious intent, such as stealing data, bypassing software protection, or damaging systems.
3.  **Script Kiddie**: An inexperienced person who uses pre-made hacking tools or scripts to attack systems, without really understanding how they work.
4.  **Corporate Spies**: Individuals hired by companies to secretly gather confidential information or trade secrets.
5.  **Unethical Employees**: Employees who exploit their inside access to steal, leak, or manipulate company data for personal gain or revenge.
6.  **Cyberextortionist**: A criminal who threatens to damage or release a company’s or individual’s data unless money is paid.
7.  **Cyberterrorist**: A person or group that uses cyber attacks to create fear, disruption, or political pressure, targeting governments, critical infrastructure, or society.

## Internet and Network Attacks

Information transmitted over networks has a higher degree of security risk than information kept on an organization’s premises.

**Malware** (malicious software) consists of programs that act without a user’s knowledge and deliberately alter the operations of computers and mobile devices.

### Common Types of Malware

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Adware** | A program that displays an online advertisement in a banner, pop-up window, or pop-under window on webpages, email messages, or other Internet services. |
| **Ransomware** | A program that blocks or limits access to a computer, phone, or file until the user pays a specified amount of money. |
| **Rootkit** | A program that hides in a computer or mobile device and allows someone from a remote location to take full control of the computer or device. |
| **Spyware** | A program that hides within or looks like a legitimate program. It secretly collects information about the user and communicates it to an outside source. |
| **Trojan horse** | A program that hides within or looks like a legitimate program. Unlike a virus or worm, it does not replicate itself to other computers. |
| **Virus** | A potentially damaging program that affects a computer or device negatively by altering the way it works without the user’s knowledge or permission. |
| **Worm** | A program that copies itself repeatedly, for example in memory or on a network, using up resources and possibly shutting down the computer, device, or network. |

### Other Attacks

*   **Botnet**: A group of compromised computers or mobile devices connected to a network. A compromised computer is known as a **zombie**.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) attack**: Disrupts computer access to an Internet service.
    *   **Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack**: A DoS attack launched from multiple compromised computers (botnet).
*   **Back door**: A program or set of instructions in a program that allow users to bypass security controls.
*   **Spoofing**: A technique intruders use to make their network or Internet transmission appear legitimate (e.g., email spoofing).

### Safeguards

*   **Firewall**: Hardware and/or software that protects a network’s resources from intrusion. It monitors and controls network traffic based on security rules.

## Unauthorized Access and Use

*   **Unauthorized access**: The use of a computer or network without permission.
*   **Unauthorized use**: The use of a computer or its data for unapproved or possibly illegal activities.

### Safeguards
*   **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**.
*   Disable file and printer sharing.
*   **Access Controls**: Define who can access a computer, device, or network; when they can access it; and what actions they can take.
    *   **Audit trail**: Records successful and unsuccessful access attempts.
*   **Username** and **Password**.
*   **CAPTCHA**: Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.
*   **Passphrase**: A private combination of words, often containing mixed capitalization and punctuation.
*   **PIN** (Personal Identification Number): A numeric password.
*   **Possessed Object**: Any item that you must possess to gain access (e.g., keycard, security token).
*   **Biometric Device**: Authenticates a person’s identity by translating a personal characteristic into a digital code (e.g., fingerprint reader, face recognition, hand geometry, iris recognition, voice verification).
*   **Two-step verification**: Uses two separate methods, one after the next, to verify the identity of a user.

## Digital Forensics

The discovery, collection, and analysis of evidence found on computers and networks.
Used in: Law enforcement, criminal prosecutors, military intelligence, insurance agencies, information security departments.

## Software Theft

Occurs when someone:
*   Steals software media.
*   Intentionally erases programs.
*   Illegally registers and/or activates a program.
*   Illegally copies a program (**Software Piracy**).

### Safeguards
*   **Product Activation**: Users provide the software product’s identification number to associate the software with the computer or mobile device.
*   **License Agreement**: The right to use software.
    *   *Single-User License*: Typically allows installation on one computer, making one backup copy, and selling the software only if removed from the original computer. It prohibits installing on a network, giving copies to friends, or renting/leasing.

## Information Theft

Occurs when someone steals personal or confidential information.

### Encryption
A process of converting data that is readable by humans into encoded characters to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Digital Signature**: An encrypted code attached to an electronic message to verify the identity of the sender.
*   **Digital Certificate**: A notice that guarantees a user or a website is legitimate.
*   **Secure Site**: A website that uses encryption techniques (often indicated by **HTTPS**).

## Hardware Theft, Vandalism, and Failure
