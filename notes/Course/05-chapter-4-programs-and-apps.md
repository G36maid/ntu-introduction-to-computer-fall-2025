# Programs and Apps (1 of 5)
A program, or software, consists of a series of related instructions, organized for a common purpose, that tells the computer what tasks to perform and how to perform them.
An application, or app, sometimes called application software, consists of programs designed to make users more productive and/or assist them with personal tasks.
An operating system is a set of programs that coordinates all the activities among computer or mobile device hardware:
Tools and utilities
System software

![An illustration shows the four steps involved in how an operating system interacts with a user, an application, and hardware with accompanying photos at each steps as follows: Step 1: An operating system user interface is displayed on the screen when a user turns on a computer. Accompanying photo shows a man working on his desktop. A zoom-out from the desktop shows windows 8 desktop with the Start menu opened. Step 2: The user instructs the operating system to run an application. Such as a word processing application, which appears on the user’s screen. The user then instructs the application to print a document. Accompanying photo shows the backstage of a word document with the print option selected in the navigation pane. A preview of the document is shown at the right of the screen and is labeled as document to be printed. Step 3: The application sends the print instruction to the computer’s operating system (software), which is running on the computer. Accompanying photo shows the CPU. Step 4: The operating system sends the print instruction to the printer (hardware), which prints the document. Accompanying photo shows a printer with the document printed in papers. A wire connection from step 1 to step 4 indicates the flow of the process.](Picture2.jpg)

# API(Application Program Interface)
在網頁上查天氣：
 使用者按下查詢 → 前端送出Request到 API
 API 接到請求 → 後端拿資料庫或外部天氣服務資料
 後端把資料回傳給 API → API 將資料傳給前端
 前端收到資料 → 顯示天氣資訊給使用者

UI                                 API
就像使用者透過UI，程式可以利用API來post request而取得資訊 e.g. web API

有什麼好處  可以寫程式達成自動化 e.g. 查天氣然後寄簡訊給你
限制  通常需要API key(可以把他想成你取得資訊的一個密碼)，很多free API key有次數限制(可能只能查10次)
怎麼用API  看document，照著他有的功能實作

# PDF
通常由文字、向量圖、點陣圖組成
為什麼PDF檔案通常比較小  經過一些壓縮技巧
壓縮的技巧 :
1. 點陣圖  JPEG  捨棄一些細節
                 FLATE  找重複資料(例如在只有黑白的圖很好用)
2. 向量圖  適度化簡公式
                 找到重複的公式
3. 文字 找重複的字
關鍵就是找到重複的，然後只存一次

# How does bar code work
起始碼 (Start) → 3 個模組（101）
系統碼 (Number System) → 1 位數字
左側數據碼 (Left Data) → 5 位數字（每位數字 7 個模組）
中間碼 (Middle Guard) → 5 個模組（01010）
右側數據碼 (Right Data) → 5 位數字
檢查碼 (Check Digit) → 1 位數字
終止碼 (End) → 3 個模組（101）

系統碼+左側數據碼+右側數據碼+檢查碼 有12位數字

檢查碼計算方式（UPC-A）：
把「奇數位」的數字相加 × 3 (用上面的: 14*3=42)
加上「偶數位」的數字 (用上面的: 42+16=58)
找到一個最小的數字，使得總和 + 這個數字 ≡ 0 (mod 10)
    (用上面的: 58+2 ≡ 0 (mod 10)，其中2是最小可能)
所以可以看到上面那張圖的check digit是2

# Disk defragmenter 磁碟重組
HDD(機械硬碟) 有磁頭，用磁頭移動到正確位置做讀寫
SSD(固態硬碟) 電子式存取，能很快找到正確位置
HDD會需要Disk defragmenter，不然磁頭一直移動比較容易毀損
Disk defragmenter的功能就是把不連續的檔案碎片變成連續的，這樣之後要讀寫就比較快(不用一直讓磁頭去找)

A disk defragmenter is a tool that reorganizes the files and unused space on a computer’s hard disk so that the operating system accesses data more quickly and programs run faster.
Defragmenting

![Two illustrations show a hard disk before and after defragmentation. The hard disk contains sectors which are numbered accordingly. The hard disk before defragmentation (fragmented hard disk) in the first illustration contains files scattered in sectors in a haphazard manner. The disk after defragmentation process in the second illustration shows the files arranged in an orderly manner.](Picture2.jpg)
Figure 4-31 A fragmented hard disk has many files stored in noncontiguous sectors. Defragmenting reorganizes the files so that they are located in contiguous sectors, which speeds access time.
