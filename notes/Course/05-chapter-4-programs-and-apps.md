## Programs and Apps (1 of 5)
- A **program**, or **software**, consists of a series of related instructions, organized for a common purpose, that tells the computer what tasks to perform and how to perform them.
- An **application**, or **app**, sometimes called application software, consists of programs designed to make users more productive and/or assist them with personal tasks.
- An **operating system** is a set of programs that coordinates all the activities among computer or mobile device hardware:
    - Tools and utilities
    - System software

![Programs and apps](Picture6.jpg)
**Figure 4-1**: Users work with a variety of programs and apps, some of which are shown in this figure.

---

## Interaction: OS, User, App, Hardware

![](Picture2.jpg)

**Figure 4-2**: This figure shows how the operating system is the interface between the user, the application(s) and other programs, and the hardware.

### Flow
1. **User** instructs **OS** to run **App**.
2. **App** sends instruction to **OS**.
3. **OS** sends instruction to **Hardware** (CPU, Printer, etc.).

---

## OS, Applications, Hardware Layers
- **Applications**
- **Operating System**
- **CPU / Memory / Devices**

---

## Execution Process
1. Program
2. Binary
3. Compilation
4. Execution (Process)

**Operating System!**

---

## API (Application Program Interface)
**Example: Checking Weather on a Webpage**
1. User clicks "Search" → Frontend sends **Request** to API.
2. API receives request → Backend retrieves data from database or external weather service.
3. Backend returns data to API → API sends data to Frontend.
4. Frontend receives data → Displays weather info to user.

---

## API Structure

**Back end** <--> **API** <--> **Front end** (UI) <--> **User**

- Just like a user uses UI, a program uses API to post requests and get info (e.g., Web API).
- **Benefits**: Automation (e.g., check weather and send SMS).
- **Limitations**: API key (like a password), rate limits (e.g., free key = 10 calls).
- **Usage**: Read documentation, implement available functions.

---

## Programs and Apps (4 of 5)

![PDF example](Picture2.jpg)
**PDF**: Portable Document Format
**Figure 4-16**: Users can edit content and add comments to a PDF document.

---

## PDF
通常由文字、向量圖、點陣圖組成。
**為什麼 PDF 檔案通常比較小?** → 經過一些壓縮技巧。

**壓縮的技巧:**
1. **點陣圖**: JPEG (捨棄一些細節), FLATE (找重複資料，例如在只有黑白的圖很好用).
2. **向量圖**: 適度化簡公式，找到重複的公式.
3. **文字**: 找重複的字.

關鍵就是找到重複的，然後只存一次。

---

## QR Code
**QR**: Quick Response

---

## How does bar code work?
- **起始碼 (Start)**: 3 個模組（101）
- **系統碼 (Number System)**: 1 位數字
- **左側數據碼 (Left Data)**: 5 位數字（每位數字 7 個模組）
- **中間碼 (Middle Guard)**: 5 個模組（01010）
- **右側數據碼 (Right Data)**: 5 位數字
- **檢查碼 (Check Digit)**: 1 位數字
- **終止碼 (End)**: 3 個模組（101）

系統碼 + 左側數據碼 + 右側數據碼 + 檢查碼 = 12 位數字

**檢查碼計算方式 (UPC-A):**
1. 把「奇數位」的數字相加 × 3 (例如: 14 * 3 = 42)
2. 加上「偶數位」的數字 (例如: 42 + 16 = 58)
3. 找到一個最小的數字，使得總和 + 這個數字 ≡ 0 (mod 10)
    (例如: 58 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 10)，其中 2 是最小可能)
所以 Check Digit 是 2。

## How about QR code?
跟 Bar code 有點像，都是用黑白代表 0/1 存資料，經過區塊分散化形成 QR code。

- **定位圖樣**: 在左上、右上、左下的大方格，告訴 scanner QR code 的方向。
- **特色**:
    1. 能存的資料量大 (最多 7000 個數字 or 4000 個字母)
    2. 可高達 30% 的容錯率 (由於有一段保護訊息)

**By ChatGPT**:
它把資料想成一個多項式，然後生成一些「多餘的點」。只要損毀沒有超過「能容忍的比例」，就能解方程式，還原出完整資料。

![](圖片9.jpg)
![](圖片12.jpg)
- Scannable (雖然稍有損毀)
- Not scannable (因為無法辨認方向了)

## Security
**What’s a computer virus?**
用來破壞、竊取、控制或干擾系統 or 資料的程式。

**Where does a virus come from?**
1. Phishing link/attachments
2. Drive-by downloads (偽裝自己是正常程式)
3. USB
4. Social engineering

**What does a virus do?**
Computer viruses generally require a **host program**. The virus writes its own code into the host program. When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage. (Wiki)
1. **Privilege escalation**
2. **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**: 連回攻擊者的伺服器，控制你的電腦
3. **Lateral movement**: 橫向存取同一網路內其他機器
4. **Identity theft, System damage, extort**

![Desktop Goose](圖片5.jpg)

---

## Security: Firewall
1. Check whether the resource IP is suspicious or not.
2. Block unknown external connection requests.
3. Limit external connections from internal programs.

**Note**: 不會深度檢查檔案本身是不是病毒。

- A **personal firewall** is a security tool that detects and protects a personal computer and its data from unauthorized intrusions.

![Firewall example](Picture2.jpg)
**Figure 4-24**: This personal firewall detected a threat to the computer and provided a means to remove the threat.

---

## Security: Antivirus
**Anti-virus program:**
- Check the code structure of a program, detect suspicious API calls.
- Detect whether a program is trying to encrypt files when running (代表他可能想勒索你).
- Run the suspicious program in a virtual and isolated environment and see what it does.

**Disadvantage**: 防毒軟體要執行掃描 → 他有比較高的權限 → 可能反而變成攻擊目標。

![Antivirus example](Picture2.jpg)
**Figure 4-25**: An antivirus program scans memory, media, and incoming email messages and attachments for viruses and attempts to remove any viruses it finds.

---

## Security Tools (3-4 of 5)
- **Spyware**: a type of program placed on a computer or mobile device without the user’s knowledge that secretly collects information about the user and then communicates the information it collects to some outside source while the user is online.
- **Adware**: a type of program that displays an online advertisement in a banner or pop-up or pop-under window on webpages, email messages, or other Internet services.
- **Spyware remover**: detects and deletes spyware.
- **Adware remover**: detects and deletes adware.

---

## Security Tools (5 of 5)
- **Anti-spam programs**: e.g., Gmail spam filter
- **Web filtering software**: e.g., Net Nanny
- **Phishing filters**: 通常內建在防毒軟體裡面
- **Pop-up and pop-under blockers**: e.g., AdBlocker

---

## File and System Management
- A **file manager** is a tool that performs functions related to file management.

![File manager example](Picture2.jpg)
**Figure 4-27**: With a file manager, you can view folders and different types of files containing documents, photos, and music.

- A **search tool** is a program... that attempts to locate a file...

![Search tool example](Picture2.jpg)

---

## Cache (快取)
- It’s faster to access data from cache than from the main memory.
- 存最近用到或常用到的 data.

**Cache replacement algorithm:**
- **FIFO** (很好做，但是通常不符合實際情況)
- **LRU** (實做比較複雜，但比較符合實際情況)
- **LFU** (最少用的踢掉)

---

## Disk Cleanup
A **disk cleanup tool** searches for and removes unnecessary files.

![Disk cleanup example](Picture2.jpg)
**Figure 4-30**: A disk cleanup tool searches for and removes unnecessary files on a computer or mobile device.

---

## Disk Defragmenter (磁碟重組)
- **HDD (機械硬碟)**: 有磁頭，用磁頭移動到正確位置做讀寫。會需要 Disk defragmenter，不然磁頭一直移動比較容易毀損。
- **SSD (固態硬碟)**: 電子式存取，能很快找到正確位置。

**Disk defragmenter** 的功能就是把不連續的檔案碎片變成連續的，這樣之後要讀寫就比較快 (不用一直讓磁頭去找)。

![Defragmentation example](Picture2.jpg)
**Figure 4-31**: A fragmented hard disk has many files stored in noncontiguous sectors. Defragmenting reorganizes the files so that they are located in contiguous sectors.

---

## File, Disk, and System Management Tools
