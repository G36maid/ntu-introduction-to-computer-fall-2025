*   Hardware can fail for a variety of reasons: aging hardware; random events such as electrical power problems; and even errors in programs or apps.
    *   Undervoltage
    *   Overvoltage or power surge

*   A **surge protector**, also called a surge suppressor, uses electrical components to provide a stable current flow and minimize the chances of an overvoltage reaching the computer and other electronic equipment.

![Figure 3-28 Circuits inside a surge protector safeguard against electrical power variations.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12345678/123456789-abcdef1234567890abcdef.png)
