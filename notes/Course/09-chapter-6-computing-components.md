## The Case (System Unit)
The **case** contains and protects the electronics of the computer or mobile device from damage.
Cases come in various shapes and sizes (e.g., desktop tower, all-in-one, laptop, tablet, smartphone, wearable, game console).

### Inside the Case
*   **Motherboard**: The main circuit board of the computer.
*   **Computer Chip**: A small piece of semiconducting material, usually silicon, on which integrated circuits are etched.

## Processors
The **Processor** (Central Processing Unit or CPU) interprets and carries out the basic instructions that operate a computer.

### Components
1.  **Control Unit**: Directs and coordinates most of the operations in the computer.
2.  **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs arithmetic, comparison, and other operations.

### Multi-core Processors
A **multi-core processor** is a single chip with two or more separate processor cores.
*   **Single-Core**: Generally faster for single tasks but slower for multitasking.
*   **Multi-Core**: Increases performance when running multiple programs simultaneously.

### The Machine Cycle
For every instruction, a processor repeats a set of four basic operations:
1.  **Fetch**: The control unit fetches instructions and data from memory.
2.  **Decode**: The control unit decodes instructions and sends them to the ALU.
3.  **Execute**: The ALU performs calculations on the data.
4.  **Store**: The results are stored in memory.

### Processor Features
*   **Registers**: Temporarily hold data and instructions.
*   **System Clock**: Controls the timing of all computer operations. Speed measured in **Gigahertz (GHz)**.
*   **Major Manufacturers**: Intel, AMD.

### Processor Cooling
Processors generate heat that can cause failure. Cooling methods include:
*   **Heat sinks**
*   **Liquid cooling technology**
*   **Cooling pads**

## Cloud Computing
Home and business users choose cloud computing for:
*   Accessibility
*   Cost savings
*   Space savings
*   Scalability

## Data Representation
Most computers are **digital**, using the **binary system** (0 and 1).
*   **Bit** (Binary Digit): The smallest unit of data (0 or 1).
*   **Byte**: A group of 8 bits. Represents a single character.
*   **ASCII**: Coding scheme used to represent data.

## Memory
Memory consists of electronic components that store:
1.  The operating system and other programs.
2.  Applications.
3.  Data being processed and resulting information.

Each byte resides temporarily in a specific location (address) in memory.
Size measured in **Gigabytes (GB)**.

### Types of Memory
1.  **Volatile Memory**: Loses contents when power is off.
    *   **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
        *   **Dynamic RAM (DRAM)**: Common, needs refreshing. Variations: SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4.
        *   **Static RAM (SRAM)**: Faster, more expensive, used for cache.
2.  **Non-volatile Memory**: Retains contents when power is off.
    *   **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: Stores permanent data/instructions (Firmware).
    *   **Flash Memory**: Can be erased and rewritten electronically.
    *   **CMOS**: Uses battery power to retain information (e.g., date/time) when computer is off.

### Memory Cache
Speeds up processing by storing frequently used instructions and data.
*   **L1 Cache**: Built into processor, fastest.
*   **L2 Cache**: Slower than L1.
*   **L3 Cache**: Separate chip or on processor, slower than L1/L2 but faster than RAM.

### Access Time
The amount of time it takes the processor to read from memory. Measured in **nanoseconds (ns)**.

## Adapters
An **adapter card** enhances functions of a component or provides connections to peripherals.
*   **Expansion Slot**: Socket on the motherboard that holds an adapter card.
*   **Plug and Play**: Computer automatically recognizes installed devices.
*   **USB Adapter**: Enhances functions of mobile computers/devices.

**Common Adapter Types**: Bluetooth, MIDI, Modem, Network, Sound, TV Tuner, USB, Video, Video Capture.

## Buses
A **bus** allows various devices inside and attached to the system unit to communicate.
*   **Data Bus**: Transfers actual data.
*   **Address Bus**: Transfers information about where data should go.
*   **Word Size**: Number of bits the processor can interpret at once.

### Types of Buses
1.  **System Bus**: Connects processor to main memory.
2.  **Backside Bus**: Connects processor to cache.
3.  **Expansion Bus**: Allows processor to communicate with peripheral devices.

## Power Supply and Batteries
*   **Power Supply**: Converts wall outlet AC power into DC power.
*   **Batteries**: Typically rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for mobile devices.

## Summary
*   Components inside computers (Case, Processor, Memory).
*   Machine Cycle (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Store).
*   Cloud Computing.
*   Data Representation (Bits, Bytes).
*   Memory Types (RAM vs. ROM/Flash).
*   Adapters and Buses.
