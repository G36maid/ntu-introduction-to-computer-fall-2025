## What Is Input?
**Input** is any data and instructions entered into the memory of a computer.
Commonly used input methods include:
*   Keyboard
*   Pointing devices
*   Touch screens
*   Pen input
*   Motion input
*   Voice input
*   Video input
*   Scanners and reading devices

## Input Devices

### Keyboards
A **keyboard** is an input device that contains keys you press to enter data and instructions.
*   **Standard Keyboard**: Includes typing area, numeric keypad, function keys, navigation keys.
*   **Ergonomic Keyboard**: Designed to reduce the chance of Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs) of wrist and hand.
*   **Mobile Options**: Clip-on tablet keyboards, built-in laptop keyboards, on-screen keyboards.

### Pointing Devices
A **pointer** is a small symbol on the screen whose location and shape change as a user moves a pointing device.
*   **Mouse**: Fits under the palm of your hand. Types: Optical, laser, touch.
*   **Touchpad**: Small, flat, rectangular pointing device sensitive to pressure and motion.
*   **Trackball**: Stationary pointing device with a ball on its top or side.

### Touch Screens
A **touch screen** is a touch-sensitive display. Users can use their thumb or finger to rotate or press buttons.

### Pen Input
Using a stylus or digital pen on a flat surface to write, draw, or make selections.
*   **Stylus vs. Digital Pen**: Tools for writing or drawing on touch-enabled devices.
*   **Graphics Tablet (Digitizer)**: Electronic plastic board that detects and converts movements of a stylus/pen into signals.

### Motion, Voice, and Video Input
*   **Motion Input (Gesture Recognition)**: Users guide on-screen elements using air gestures (e.g., Wii controller, Kinect).
*   **Voice Input**: Entering input by speaking into a microphone.
    *   **Voice Recognition**: Capability of distinguishing spoken words (e.g., Siri).
*   **Audio Input**: Entering sound (speech, music, sound effects) into the computer.
*   **Video Input**: Capturing full-motion images.
    *   **Webcam**: Digital Video (DV) camera for capturing video/images, video calls, and conferencing.
    *   **Videoconference**: Meeting between geographically separated people via video.

## Scanners and Reading Devices

### Scanners
A **scanner** is a light-sensing input device that reads printed text and graphics and translates results into digital form.
*   **Flatbed Scanner**: Works like a copy machine but creates a file in memory.

### Reading Devices
*   **Optical Reader**: Uses a light source to read characters, marks, and codes.
    *   **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Reads characters.
    *   **OMR (Optical Mark Recognition)**: Reads marks (e.g., Scantron).
*   **Bar Code Reader**: Uses laser beams to read bar codes.
*   **QR Code**: Stores information in both vertical and horizontal directions.
*   **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**: Uses radio signals to communicate with a tag placed in or attached to an object. Used for tracking runners, inventory, tolls, etc.
*   **Magstripe Reader**: Reads the magnetic stripe on the back of cards (credit cards, ID cards).
*   **MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition)**: Reads text printed with magnetized ink (used in banking for checks).
*   **Data Collection Device**: Obtains data directly at the location where the transaction or event takes place.

## Output
**Output** is data that has been processed into a useful form.
Types: Text, Graphics, Audio, Video.

## Displays
A **display** visually conveys text, graphics, and video information.
*   **Monitor**: Display packaged as a separate peripheral device (e.g., LCD).
*   **Quality Factors**: Resolution, Response time, Brightness, Dot pitch, Contrast ratio.
*   **Ports**: DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort.
*   **Smart TV**: Internet-enabled HDTV.
*   **Medical Display**: Specialized high-resolution, high-brightness displays for medical imaging.

## Printers
A **printer** produces text and graphics on a physical medium.

### Nonimpact Printers
Forms characters/graphics without contacting the paper.
*   **Ink-jet Printer**: Sprays tiny drops of liquid ink. Measured in PPM (Pages Per Minute).
*   **Photo Printer**: Produces lab-quality photos.
*   **Laser Printer**: High-speed, high-quality, uses laser beam and toner.
*   **All-in-one Printer (Multifunction)**: Prints, scans, copies, faxes.
*   **3-D Printer**: Creates objects by adding material layer by layer (additive manufacturing).
*   **Thermal Printer**: Pushes electrically heated pins against heat-sensitive paper (or dye-sublimation).
*   **Mobile Printer**: Small, battery-powered.
*   **Label Printer**: Prints on adhesive-type material.
*   **Plotters / Large-format Printers**: For high-quality drawings and posters.

### Impact Printers
Forms characters by striking a mechanism against an inked ribbon (e.g., Dot matrix).

## Audio and Other Output
*   **Speakers**: Surround sound systems for higher-quality sound.
*   **Headphones / Earbuds**: Personal audio output.
*   **Data Projector**: Projects images onto a larger screen.
*   **Interactive Whiteboard**: Touch-sensitive board displaying connected computer screen.
*   **Force Feedback**: Game controllers sending resistance in response to user actions.

## Summary
*   Variety of options for input (Keyboards, Pointing devices, Scanners, RFID, etc.) and output (Displays, Printers, Audio).
*   Assistive technology options.

## Review Questions
1.  **Write down three types of input devices.** (e.g., Keyboard, Touch screen, Digital pen)
2.  **What is the full form of RFID?** (Radio Frequency Identification)
3.  **How does a 3-D printer work?** (Adding material to a three-dimensional object, one horizontal layer at a time)

## Project (Due Dec 5)
*   Use scanner to scan a page (page number = ID number).
*   Use OCR software to convert image into text.
*   Format in Microsoft Word (right-justify, bold).
*   Print on a laser printer.
