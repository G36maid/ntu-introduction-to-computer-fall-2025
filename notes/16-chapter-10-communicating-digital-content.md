## Communications
**Digital communications** describes a process in which two or more computers or devices transfer data, instructions, and information.

### Network
A **network** is a collection of computers and devices connected together via communications devices and transmission media.
**Advantages**:
*   Facilitating communications.
*   Sharing hardware, data, information, and software.
*   Transferring funds.

### Network Types
*   **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Connects computers in a limited geographical area (e.g., home, office).
*   **WLAN (Wireless LAN)**: A LAN that uses no physical wires.
*   **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Connects LANs in a metropolitan area.
*   **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers a large geographic area (e.g., the Internet).
*   **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Connects devices in an individual’s workspace (wired or wireless).

### Network Architecture
*   **Client/Server Network**:
    *   **Server**: Central computer controlling access to resources.
    *   **Client**: Computers that rely on the server.
    *   *Pros*: Centralized management, higher security. *Cons*: Higher cost, central point of failure.
*   **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network**:
    *   Each computer shares its hardware/software with others directly.
    *   *Pros*: Lower cost, easy setup. *Cons*: Decentralized management, lower security, performance drops with many users.

## Network Communications Standards and Protocols
*   **Ethernet**: Standard specifying no central device controls transmission timing (nodes contend for access).
*   **Token Ring**: Devices share/pass a special signal (token) to transmit.
*   **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: Defines how messages (data) are routed from one end of a network to another.
*   **Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)**: 802.11 standard for wireless communication.
*   **LTE (Long-Term Evolution)**: High-speed cellular transmission standard.
*   **Bluetooth**: Short-range radio waves for transmitting data between two devices.
*   **UWB (Ultra-Wide Band)**: Short-range, high-speed radio waves.
*   **IrDA (Infra-red Data Association)**: Transmits data wirelessly via Infrared light.
*   **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**: Uses radio signals to communicate with tags.
*   **NFC (Near-Field Communication)**: Close-range radio signals (based on RFID) for communication between devices (e.g., contactless payments).

## Communications Lines
*   **Cable**: High speed, uses CATV network.
*   **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**: Transmits on phone lines. **ADSL** supports faster downstream than upstream rates.
*   **FTTP (Fiber To The Premises)**: Extremely fast, uses fiber optics.
*   **T-Carrier**: Dedicated digital lines (T1, T3).
*   **ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)**: High-speed service.

## Communications Devices
Hardware capable of transmitting data between sending and receiving devices.
*   **Broadband Modem**: Sends/receives data from a digital line (Cable, DSL).
*   **Wireless Modem**: Uses mobile phone network to connect to Internet.
*   **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**: Central device allowing wireless data transfer.
*   **Router**: Connects multiple computers/routers and transmits data to correct destinations.
*   **Network Card**: Enables a computer to access a network.
*   **Hub/Switch**: Central point for cables in a network.

## Transmission Media
Carries one or more communications signals. **Bandwidth** is the amount of data that can travel. **Latency** is the time it takes a signal to travel.

### Physical Media
*   **Twisted-Pair Cable**: Common in LANs and landline phones.
*   **Coaxial Cable**: Copper wire, used in CATV.
*   **Fiber-Optic Cable**: Strands of glass/plastic carrying data as light pulses. Fast and secure.

### Wireless Media
*   **Infrared**: Light waves.
*   **Broadcast Radio**: Radio signals over long distances.
*   **Cellular Radio**: Wide use for mobile communications.
*   **Microwaves**: High-speed signal transmission (line-of-sight).
*   **Communications Satellite**: Space station receiving/amplifying signals (e.g., GPS).
    *   **GPS (Global Positioning System)**: Navigation system using satellites to determine location.

## Summary
*   Network architectures (LAN, WAN, Client/Server, P2P).
*   Protocols (TCP/IP, Wi-Fi, RFID, NFC).
*   Hardware (Routers, Modems).
*   Transmission Media (Wired vs. Wireless).
