## Storage vs. Memory

### Storage
*   **Storage Medium**: The physical material on which a computer keeps data, information, programs, and applications.
*   **Non-volatile**: Contents remain when power is off.
*   **Writing**: Process of transferring items from memory to a storage medium.
*   **Reading**: Process of transferring items from a storage medium into memory.
*   **Capacity**: The amount of data a storage medium can hold.

### Memory (RAM)
*   **Volatile**: Contents are erased when power is removed.
*   **Function**: Stores data waiting to be processed by the processor.

### Access Time
*   The amount of time it takes a storage device to locate an item on a storage medium.
*   The time required to deliver an item from memory to the processor.

## Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
*   **Components**: Contains **platters** with magnetic coating.
*   **Capacity Factors**: Number of platters, composition of magnetic coating, recording method (longitudinal vs. perpendicular), and **density**.
*   **Mechanism**: Read/write heads float above the spinning platters to read/write data.

## Solid-State Drives (SSD)
*   **Technology**: Flash memory storage device containing its own processor to manage storage.
*   **Advantages over HDD**:
    *   Less power consumption.
    *   Less heat generation.
    *   Longer life (no moving parts).
    *   Defragmentation not required.

## External and Enterprise Storage

### External Hard Drive
A separate freestanding storage device that connects with a cable to a USB port or other port on a computer or mobile device.

### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
Technology that combines multiple physical hard drives into one logical unit to improve **performance**, **reliability**, or both.
*   **Methods**: Striping (distributing data) or Mirroring (duplicating data).
*   **Benefit**: Allows system to keep running even if one drive fails.

### Network-Attached Storage (NAS)
A dedicated file storage device that provides centralized data access to multiple users and client devices over a network. Operates as an independent unit.

## Portable Flash Memory Storage

### Memory Cards
Removable flash memory storage device (e.g., SD, microSD, CF).
*   **Non-volatile**.
*   **Technology**: Stores info by trapping electric charges inside microscopic cells.
*   **Components**: Controller (manages data/errors), Flash Memory Chip (stores data), Interface.

### USB Flash Drives
Portable flash memory storage that plugs into a USB port.
**USB (Universal Serial Bus)**: Standard interface for data transfer and power delivery.

## Optical Discs
Storage medium that uses **laser light** to read and write data.
*   **Surface**: Microscopic patterns of **pits** (depressions) and **lands** (flat areas).
*   **Reading**: Laser reflects off lands (1) and scatters off pits (0).

## Specialized Storage Technology

### Magnetic Stripe Cards
Plastic card with a magnetic stripe on the back (e.g., credit cards, student IDs).
*   **Composition**: Tiny ferromagnetic particles magnetized in different directions.
*   **Reader**: Detects changing magnetic fields and converts them to electrical signals.

### Smart Cards
Plastic card embedded with a **microchip** (microprocessor + memory).
*   **Function**: Stores data, processes information, performs secure authentication/encryption.
*   **Uses**: Banking, SIM cards, ID cards.

### RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
Uses radio waves to identify, track, or manage objects.
*   **Components**: Tag (chip + antenna), Reader, Host System.
*   **Advantage**: **Contactless** (no line of sight needed).
*   **Uses**: Logistics, electronic tickets, animal tracking.

### NFC (Near Field Communication)
Short-range wireless communication technology (typically within 4 cm).
*   **Evolution**: Evolved from RFID.
*   **Feature**: Two-way communication (reading and writing).

## Cloud Storage
A model of data storage where digital information is saved on remote servers accessed through the Internet.
*   **Management**: Managed by cloud service providers.
*   **Benefits**: Accessibility, Cost savings, Space savings, Scalability.

## Summary
*   Variety of storage options (HDD, SSD, Optical, Flash).
*   Storage capacity vs. Access time.
*   Enterprise solutions (RAID, NAS).
*   Specialized tech (Smart cards, RFID, NFC).
*   Cloud storage advantages.
