!["An illustration shows the six steps involved in how a home user’s request for a webpage might travel the Internet using cable internet service with accompanying photos at each step as follows: Step 1: You send a request to the Internet. For example, you enter the web address of a webpage you want to visit in the address bar of your browser. Accompanying photo shows a villa. Step 2: A cable modem transfers the computer’s digital signals to the cable television line in your house. Accompanying photo shows a modem. Step 3: Your request (digital signals) travels through cable television lines to a central cable system, which is shared by up to 500 homes in a neighbourhood. Accompanying photo shows a server. Step 4: The central cable system sends your request over high-speed fiber-optic lines to the cable operator, who often also is the ISP. Accompanying photo shows a high-rise building of an organisation. Step 5: The ISP routes your request through the Internet backbone to the destination server (in this example, the server that contains the requested webpage). Accompanying photo shows a globe with ISP routes. Step 6: The server retrieves the requested webpage and sends it back through the Internet backbone to your computer. Accompanying photos show a rack in a server room stacked with files, and a screenshot of ebay webpage."](Picture2.jpg)

An IP address is a sequence of numbers that uniquely identifies the location of each computer or device connected to the Internet or any other network
A domain name is a text-based name that corresponds to the IP address of a server
A DNS (Domain Name System) server translates the domain name into its associated IP address

!["An illustration shows the three steps involved in how a browser displays a requested webpage with accompanying photos at each steps as follows: Step 1: Run the browser and enter the web address in the browser’s address bar. Accompanying photo shows the web address with a domain name typed as “google.com” in the address bar, a cancel button is shown on the right. Step 2: The browser communicates with a DNS server maintained by your ISP or another provider. The DNS server looks up the domain name portion of the web address, finds its associated IP address, and then sends the IP address to your computer or mobile device. Accompanying photo shows DNS servers. Flow lines flow in both directions between Step 1 and Step 2 indicating the operation of a DNS server. A flow line from Step 1 to Step 2 carries the web address with the domain name “google.com,” and the flow line from Step 2 to Step 1 carries the IP addresses: 74.125.22.139; 2001:4860:4860::8844. From Step 1, the flow lines flow to Step 3 after receiving the IP address from Step 2, and it carries the same to Step 3. Step 3: The browser uses the IP address to contact the web server at the specified IP address to request the content of the desired webpage. The web server fulfills the user’s request by sending the desired content to the user’s browser, which formats the page for display on the screen. Accompanying photo shows the webpage of google.com with a search bar. "](Picture2.jpg)
DNS: Domain Name Server
Figure 2-6 This figure show how a user’s entered domain name (google.com) uses a DNS server to display a webpage (Google, in this case).

The World Wide Web (WWW), or web, consists of a worldwide collection of electronic documents (webpages)
A website is a collection of related webpages and associated items
A web server is a computer that delivers requested webpages to your computer or mobile device
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a set of symbols that developers use to specify the headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content elements that a webpage contains

### Notes:
WWW: 全球資訊網
網站 website(維基百科)=多個相關網頁 webpage(維基百科其中一個搜尋頁面)和物件(資工系:點擊進入不同頁面、下載檔案)

<!-- Slide number: 81 -->

!["An illustration shows the four steps involved in how an email message may travel from a sender to a receiver with accompanying photos at each steps as follows: Step 1: Using an email program, you create and send a message on a computer or mobile device. Accompanying photo shows an email message on the screen of a desktop computer. Step 2: Your email program contacts software on the outgoing mail server. Accompanying photo shows a server. Step 3: Software on the outgoing mail server determines the best route for the data and sends the message, which travels along Internet routers to the recipient's incoming mail server. Accompanying photo shows the two internet routers. Step 4: When the recipient uses an email program to check for email messages, the message transfers from the incoming mail server to the recipient's computer or mobile device. Accompanying photos show an incoming mail service illustrated as a rack from where it transfers the email to a smartphone. The photo also shows a new email received on the screen of the smartphone."](Picture5.jpg)

# Netiquette
Netiquette is the code of acceptable Internet behavior users should follow while on the Internet

!["An illustration shows the Netiquette guidelines for online communications as follows: Golden Rule: Treat others as you would like them to treat you. Be polite. Avoid offensive language. Avoid sending or posting flames, which are abusive or insulting messages. Do not participate in flame wars, which are exchanges of flames. Be careful when using sarcasm and humor, as it might be misinterpreted. Do not use all capital letters, which is the equivalent of SHOUTING! Popular emojis include: Lack of knowledge; Approval; Tears of joy; Love; Happiness; and Boredom. Use abbreviations and acronyms for phrases: BTW by the way; IMHO in my humble opinion; FYI for your information; TTFN ta ta for now; FWIW for what it’s worth; TYVM thank you very much. Clearly identify a spoiler, which is a message that reveals an outcome to a game or ending to a movie or program. Be forgiving of other’s mistakes. Read the FAQ (frequently asked questions), if one exists."](Picture2.jpg)
